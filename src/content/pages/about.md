![Menn at Seed Webs](/img/about-menn.jpg)

I'm Menn Chakkrisn Talawat, a web designer and developer who transitioned from Bangkok to Pai, leading the team at Seed Webs.

## 2003

After returning from the US, where I pursued a Media Production course, I founded TiGER iDEA, my first web studio in Bangkok.

## 2011

I volunteered to teach design and web development at the Maehongson IT Valley project by NECTEC and co-founded SAM YARN Digital Agency before relocating to Pai.

## 2016

I established Seed Themes in Pai, focusing on WordPress theme development and recruiting recent graduates from Mahongson and Chiang Mai.

## 2017

I found love in Pai with a local nurse. Together, we constructed both our home and office in Pai.

## 2020

I rebranded my company as Seed Webs, expanding into various web technologies like Next.js, React, MongoDB, Vue.js, and Astro, while maintaining our commitment to innovation.

Next.js versions 13 and 14 introduced the concept of Server Actions, providing a standard approach for submitting data to the server without the need for explicit API endpoints. This method is particularly well-suited for form submissions.

## Server Actions and Revalidating Data

While Server Actions handle the process of sending data to the server, they do not automatically update the client-side view with the latest data. To ensure the client reflects the updated information, such as a newly created Todo item, we can utilize the Revalidating Data feature.

Revalidating Data instructs Next.js to fetch the latest data from the server instead of relying on cached data. This ensures that the client-side view remains synchronized with the server-side state.

## Recommended Video Tutorials:

I highly recommend checking out these two videos that delve into Server Actions and Revalidating Data in Next.js:

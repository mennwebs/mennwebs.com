Recently, my friend @BugFirst requested to upload a video I made about WordPress to YouTube. So, I thought I'd share it here as well.

In this video, I discuss case studies of using WordPress to create various types of websites, including magazines, e-commerce platforms, and Line OA accounts.

If you're interested, you can watch the video (Thai language) here: [Live from National Coding Day 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXAf2vb6x2Q)

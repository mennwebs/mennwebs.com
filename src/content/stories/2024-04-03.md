Ever since the Site Editor/Full Site Editing system was released a few years ago, I've found it difficult to use in real-world projects. Even after releasing the [Bai](https://wordpress.org/themes/bai/) and [Pai](https://wordpress.org/themes/pai-page/) themes, I still felt like many features were missing.

Last night, WordPress released version 6.5, which adds new features and improves performance. I believe this could be a turning point for Site Editor adoption and make it the new standard for WordPress usage.

For general users, the most noticeable improvements include easier page layout, faster drag-and-drop editing, direct font uploading, and more convenient block settings.

For developers, there are a number of new APIs that open up new possibilities:

Interactivity API: This will make it possible to pull data in real time without the need for scattered libraries.
Block Bindings API: This will make it easier to connect blocks to custom fields or pull data from other sources.
Plugin Dependencies: This will allow plugins to require other plugins to be installed before they can be used, without the need for custom code.

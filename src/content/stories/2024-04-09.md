> Domain Change: WooCommerce.com → Woo.com → WooCommerce.com

## Background

Late last year, WooCommerce rebranded to Woo and changed their main domain name accordingly. This resulted in a significant drop in traffic, from 300K visitors per day to just over 100K. Even after 5 months, the traffic had not recovered.

## Reversal of Decision

As a result of the traffic loss, WooCommerce announced that they would be reverting back to their original domain name, WooCommerce.com.

## Conclusion

This case study serves as a reminder that Google can be very sensitive to changes in domain names. As such, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of any domain name changes before making them.

For WordPress websites with multiple team members or a membership system, it can be challenging to keep track of individual user actions and prevent accidental data modifications or deletions.

To address this issue, I recommend using the User Activity Tracking and Log plugin by Moove Agency. This plugin effectively records user activities without overloading the server, ensuring that you maintain a clear history of user actions and changes.

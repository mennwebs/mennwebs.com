WordCamp events, the global gatherings dedicated to WordPress, are known for their unique mascots called Wapuu. Each Wapuu takes on a different form, reflecting the theme and location of the event.

This year, WordCamp Asia 2024 is being held in Taiwan, and the adorable Wapuu mascot has taken the form of a delicious xiao long bao, a popular Taiwanese steamed bun.

To keep up with the latest event updates, visit [asia.wordcamp.org/2024](https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/). And if you're curious about other Wapuu designs, check out [wapu.us](https://wapu.us/).

**P.S.** Our Seed Webs team of 10 will be attending WordCamp Asia 2024 in Taiwan! While we would normally open up applications for additional team members for such events, we're all set with our 10-person team this time around. Instead, we encourage you to join us as a partner or become a Seed Kit member.

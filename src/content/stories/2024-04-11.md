I've been wanting to create an example website using WordPress + WooCommerce to sell digital products for a long time, but I couldn't decide what to sell. Selling themes/plugins seemed too complicated and not suitable for a wide audience. Selling slides/PDFs/sample Excel files for business calculations would require a lot of sample files to be created.

In the end, we decided to sell something simple like Tarot card cat wallpapers, which people are actually selling online. So the team used Midjourney to create Tarot card cat wallpapers and then refined them.

You can try it out at [mu3.seeddemo.com](https://mu3.seeddemo.com).

Use the code `FREEMEOW` to download one wallpaper for free.

If you're interested in using this example as a starting point, you can purchase the Plant 3 theme at [Seed Webs - Plant 3 Theme](https://th.seedwebs.com/product/plant/).

After using Gemini to translate articles to mennwebs.com frequently, I found that:

1.  Gemini provides three translation options: the first is the most verbose, the second is moderate, and the third is the most concise. I currently choose the second option.
2.  The translated text includes headings, bold text, lists, etc. If I want to convert this to a Markdown file, there will be duplication. So I searched for "text to markdown" and found this link: [rich-text-to-markdown.com](https://www.rich-text-to-markdown.com/). It's very easy! Just paste the text from Gemini and copy the Markdown for use.

Another option is [Word to Markdown Converter](https://goonlinetools.com/word-to-markdown/), which has a simple interface but is convenient for continuous use.

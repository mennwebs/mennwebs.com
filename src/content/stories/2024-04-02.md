Web Components is a UI Kit with HTML code that can be used with any web language (because it's made in HTML).
Web Components is the definition of new HTML tags, such as <tabs> or <banner>, and then the associated code is specified.

The Font Awesome team acquired the Shoelace project in October 2022 and has been developing only the free version ever since.
Until they are about to release a new version, both free and pro (same model as Font Awesome) and open fundraising on Kickstarter.

There are a lot of people investing in it now, up to $300,000 from a target of $30,000.

description: I looked for other options and came across this plugin, which turned out to be better than I expected. It can create filter systems for any Custom Post Type and search any Custom Field. It feels like a simplified version of FacetWP that's easier for everyone to use. The free version is also very good.

WooCommerce recently warned that the Premmerce Product Filter plugin doesn't support the new Woo and slows down the website.

So I looked for other options and came across this plugin, which turned out to be better than I expected. It can create filter systems for any Custom Post Type and search any Custom Field. It feels like a simplified version of FacetWP that's easier for everyone to use. The free version is also very good.

I've added it to the new demo website I'm working on at https://mu3.seeddemo.com/shop/ to show how to use the Plant theme to create a website for selling digital products. This will be released with the Plant 3 update in mid-this month.

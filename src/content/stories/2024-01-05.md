## Midjourney: The AI that Creates Beautiful Images from Prompts

Midjourney, now in its 6th version, is a popular AI tool that allows users to generate stunning images from text prompts. Their official guide on using prompts can be found at [https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts). For more detailed explanations, search for "Midjourney Prompt How to".

## A Simpler Approach: Explore and Copy Prompts

Personally, I prefer a simpler method:

1.  Go to [https://www.midjourney.com/explore](https://www.midjourney.com/explore).
2.  Enter your desired search term, such as "cute" or "cat".
3.  Browse the generated images and find one that you like.
4.  Click the "Copy Prompt" button.
5.  Modify the prompt to further refine your desired image.

## Example Prompt:

Using the prompt "A cute fat rabbit character design, in style of POP MART, 3D style, super details, OC render" resulted in this adorable cover image.
